- [x] add TIM data (cleaned)
- [x] add 2023 TIP data (cleaned)
- [x] finish reformatting
- [ ] TIL page
- [ ] TIM page
- [x] fix predict_plot function to work with the reactive models
  - this probably isn't possible, (it is, assuming i change the entire app architecture) and it's such a niche application i'm not going to bother
- [ ] flesh out background
- [x] add photos to background page
  - [ ] fix pest picture sizes (make them smaller)
- [x] TIT statistics
- [x] consider leaflet? it would make for some compelling visuals
  - i'm not going to do this. just grab a screenshot from google earth if i want to show the greenhouses from above. leaflet is SO overkill for this.
