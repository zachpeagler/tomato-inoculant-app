- [x] add TIM data (cleaned)
- [x] add 2023 TIP data (cleaned)
- [x] finish reformatting
- [x] TIL page
- [x] TIM page
- [x] fix predict_plot function to work with the reactive models
  - this probably isn't possible, (it is, assuming i change the entire app architecture) and it's such a niche application i'm not going to bother
- [x] flesh out background
  - [x] add blossom end-rot picture to tomato card and explain what causes it
- [x] add photos to background page
  - [x] fix pest picture sizes (make them smaller)
- [x] TIT statistics
- [x] consider leaflet? it would make for some compelling visuals
  - i'm not going to do this. just grab a screenshot from google earth if i want to show the greenhouses from above. leaflet is SO overkill.

- [x] add acknowledgements to about page
  - under "About the Author"
- [x] update info tab for IMT, ILT, and ITT
  - [x] add photosynq and multispeq pics
    - not doing this, feels out of place
  - [x] add trial specific pics
    - [x] IMT
    - [x] ILT
    - [x] ITT
  - [x] ensure methods are correct
  - [x] separate variables out by dataset (i.e. fluoro, fruit)
- [x] consider adding time to fluorescence models

- [x] improve mobile compatibility
  - [x] improve picture scaling
    - the easiest way to do this would be to manually resize all the pictures to the desired size, then they would automatically scale with the shiny application. (this is already happening with the pest pictures because i cropped them to 400x400.)
  - [x] move plot titles from inside the plots (being generated by ggplot2) to outside the plots in a separate markdown element. this would mean that they can't be reactive (unless we created additional reactive expressions for them >:)
  - [x] move all legends to be on the bottom of figures. massively improves readability on narrow screens.
- [x] add granule development nav_page
  - cut for time
- [x] fix ITT mass model annotation (y = 200)
- [x] fix ITT fruit count model annotation (y = 30)
- [x] replace "psugar" with just "sugar"
  - keep it simple
- [x] update stomates card on background tab
- [x] redo text on green revolution and synthetic fertilizers
- [x] add paper links to citations and add all remaining citations to references section in about tab
  - [x] microbes as sustainable agriculture solutions
  - [x] biopolymer immobilization
